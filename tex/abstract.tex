This book collects different ideas together to form frame agreement for digital
trade system holding producers, vendors, service providers, authorities,
financial institutions, companies and individual customer roles in the created
ecosystem. Purpose is to create fair, nondiscrinanting ecosystem over digital
tradesystem and frame agreement, which supports traditional business models and
maybe some new ones too, same time offering much much more frictionless trade
and possibility to implement and import process improvements for further even
more frictionless trading by standardizing, workarounds for developing
countries. Bringing digital trading, electronic commerce to level it should be;
having electric label services created as separate technology development
project for farmers as way to note that what is they variety in the standard
box, instead default assumption "bulk tasteless red water balls"-default
delivery for tomato. It is unfair for those farmers producing good tasting bit
slowly growing varieties. While created and successful operation is
demonstrated then law change could be introduced to allow to have only electric
label, which is then put to e-paper or printed out for normal paper or
cardboard if someone needs it in physical from. After change this created
service is the first one on market ready to serve automated delivery chains
labeling without printing needs.
