\index{frame framing}

Digital trading, e-commerce as frame agreement backed ecosystem service
platform. Few ideas from digital trading, e-com\-mer\-ce platforms which
traditionally has been thought too narrow mind\-ed way, concentrating to
single customer usability questions, vendor viewpoint or service provider
viewpoint and then drifted to existing setup. It has been enough because there
is no serious competition from government or society driven frameworks.
Actually this area is much, much broader what has to be covered for successful
platform forming ecosystem services.

To be able to form ecosystem services for full delivery chain, from initial
raw material producer to final consumer and recycling, you have to have strong
value based idea from fair and sustainable way created ecosystem. Ecosystem
which can be accepted globally by original producer, final customer, and
society from socioeconomic perspectives. Ecosystem which is enough aligned
with legal framework and government, like with EU digital strategy, so it can
be accepted to be used and supported by government, and which is financed by
offering clear role for financing institutions, therefore having motivation to
back up technology. Then banks have clear future role. When public setup is
widely copied it can't be wiped away, instead current major players are
encouraged to join the movement.

To get to widely accepted and popular ecosystem services into place there has
to be widely accepted rules how ecosystem services operate, how they improve
every participants life. Therefore publicity especially for ecosystem own
rules has to be clear, documents freely available and understandable for
regular peoples. For legal framework there can be an another freely available
public set of legal documents setting these clear explanations into practice.

Now there is no other needed level agreements than some "free trade
agreements" -- and are those on needed level for acceptable ecosystem
services? Those really are not adequate at all, or limited to too narrow
niche.

Biggest risk here is that EU government really doesn't understand what they
are doing. Legal body has demanding and denial legal rules mostly in mind when
they do something. These both are mostly limiting and distracting ways to
build anything new. They also have possibility to finance some new initiatives
if they understand what they should do. Good example from EU activities is
this new Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)\cite{EU_CRA}. EU should actually finance
open hardware and open software reference implementations tested against major
Open Source Hardware (OSH) and Open Source Software (OSS) releases and put to
public repository usable with Fedora, Debian, Rasbian,.. etc. for
semiautomatic and automatic deployments directly from repositories to device
having hardware implementation\cite{ISO_IEC_19790} done. Understanding,
financing and execution of this kind of operations is not EU strength area.
For example eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust
Services) node implementation statistics \cite{eIDASnode} show that services
are implemented, but countries have they own implementations still in use,
like BeID, EstEID, FINeID, so even EU has some reference implementation
available countries utilize they own and cooperation seem to be hard to get
working. Belgium has had quite long time this open client implementation which
is brought to be part of major OSS distributions, so even this kind of open
implementations exists and freely available, it seems that EU is not capable
to add some localization support and take good solution into wider use.
Maybe hyped DC4EU (Digital Credentials For European Union) project\cite{DC4EU}
produce EUDI (EU Digital Identity) wallet\cite{EUDIW} which will be the
execption to this. Or does it?

Platform strategy creation viewpoints.
When we look ex\-ist\-ing digital trading platforms having some kind of
ecosystem around, we notice that the terms of ecosystem for single vendor are
proprietary and prohibitive, many ways limiting vendor possibilities to
operate on market. There are few of those platforms available and clear sense
says that there is need at least for EU wide ecosystem rules as public frame
agreement created in way that it could be extended globally after a while.
Figure \ref{fig:TermSets} on page \pageref{fig:TermSets}, opens situation and
needed frame.

  \caption{Existing digital trade rule sets and need for EU wide public
	 nondiscriminating rule set for platform based ecosystem}
  \label{fig:TermSets}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

To approach this frame agreement controlled digital trade platform idea from
digital marketing strategy perspective to really be able to go details we need
some clarity for thinking. There is good model for strategic analysis and
planning views of digital marketing from single vendor perspective at (Heikki
Karjaluoto et al. book \cite{Karjaluoto2022}, Figure 1: Book structure, Page
10). Inspired to extend this Vendor's Strategic analysis and planning of
digital marketing -- cake model to cover Digital Trade Platform Marketing
Strategy -layer based to this idea of foundation or cooperation managed frame
agreement based platform setup having related technology selection,
partnering, public relations and customer acquisition in own hand. On extended
model kept that single vendor as customer, added platform layer underneath
model and we got extended platform marketing cake model we can iteratively use
to evaluate different players viewpoints to platform digital marketing
strategy, figure \ref{fig:TradeMarketValueGrowth} on page
\pageref{fig:TradeMarketValueGrowth}.

\begin{figure} %[H] %\usepackage{float}
 \begin{center}
  \epsfig{figure=figures/dTMVGstr.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Digital Trade Market Value Growth (TMVG)
	 strategy analysis and planning}
  \label{fig:TradeMarketValueGrowth}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Original model round MVG (Market-Value-Growth) cake model form changed to
triangles to speed up work. While adding and taking new bottom Trade platform
layer as major viewpoint for this TMVG (Trade-Market-Value-Growth) cake model,
where original vendor MVG model rotated half a round at the center of extended
model. Side view from layers on figure \ref{fig:TradeMarketValueGrowthLayers}

 \epsfig{figure=figures/dTMVGcw.eps,width=\textwidth}
 \caption{Digital TMVG strategy analysis and planning model layers front view}
 \label{fig:TradeMarketValueGrowthLayers}
\end{center}\end{figure}
While this cake model is now extended for Trade platform we have to extend
it's operational part mRACE \cite{SDM2022} (measured Reach Act Convert Engage)
figure meant for Operational implementation of digital marketing as well
(Heikki Karjaluoto et al. book \cite{Karjaluoto2022}, Figure 1: Book structure,
Page 11) what is already extended model from Chaffrey RACE \cite{ChaffreyRACE}
(Reach Act Convert Engage).

We have to sell our frame agreement defined way to do business for
participants. It should be easier than pure technology implementation project
sale because frame agreement can be defined long lasting, instead technology
which changes after while, so everyone understands that investment is for
longer period even technologies and process underneath could change. This
mRACE model is extended with Involvement and Incorporate steps which are used
on all levels for all players namely for customer, influencer and vendor.
Created frame agreement and initial technical definition has to have enough
benefits to roll up some business areas fully over platform services. This is
platform selling for vendor. For vendor inclusion means that they invest they
time and money to collaborate on frame agreement, business process and
technical implementation level. Incorporation means that they select platform
for they business and support platform operation and development with they
turnover tied fees and perhaps be members of foundation or cooperative
maintaining the platform. All these can be measured by using public code and
documentation repositories having review and reporting capabilities for
registered users and participating patrons representing they organization.
This mRACEII (measured Reach Act Convert Engage Involve Incorporate) digital
marketing operational implementation figure \ref{fig:mRACEII} on page
\pageref{fig:mRACEII}. Customer and influencer cases are explained later on
this document.

\end{center}\end{figure}

\section{Strategy creation}
\label{strategy_creation}
\index{strategy creation}
Ecosystem frame agreement embedded strategy creation.
As stated earlier most needed and valued participants on ecosystem are initial
product or service creators and final customers who pay the bill. Everything
else between there is for just business, and will participate anyway after
these first two major groups are done decision to move on this platform. At
the beginning we have to think big to get some idea from scalable future proof
framework what is then implemented in legal agreements, clear text
explanations and actual technical design, all step by step trying to implement
most needed parts first, still keeping in mind wide perspective to maintain
future proof implementation. It makes sense to listen original creator and
final customer rights balance driving organizations like EDRi, NCUC, NPOC to
get as high acceptance for platform and frame agreement as possible. This
requires different viewpoints opinions regular iteration and improvements
implementation to frame agreement and actual platform services as seen on
figure \ref{fig:iteration} on page \pageref{fig:iteration}. Similar iterative
strategy process introduced at NRWA Conference by N.N.\cite{NNlostAtNRWC2022},
and there are also older documents explaining strategy loops.

\begin{figure}\begin{center}
\epsfig{figure=figures/iterat.eps,width=\textwidth}
\caption{Iterative process}
\label{fig:iteration}
\end{center}\end{figure}

These iterative loops has to be repeated regularly based to follow up need and
need to be able to adjust strategy. frame agreement and platform
implementation according to changes found from business environment; legal
environment, technology sector, market area, social environment, trends,
standardizations, and logistics services operating on market area.

Bottom layer holding platform trade technology services, and it's the most
investment intensive layer because it's implementing and operating technical
framework for all upper layer defined needs and services. This includes
terminal software for producer, vendor, archival, logistics, toll, tax,
vendor, trade, banking, sourcing, maintenance, recycling services and
service integrations.

Top of bottom layer sits market area, which holds all regions, countries
business areas and customer groups platform supports are enabled for. Each
region, technology area and customer group may have they own requirements,
which you have to take in account when creation platform strategy. It may also
include decision that certain business area or regions are left without
support from platform side. And it may be wise to limit supported trading to
traditionally widely accepted business modes without cheating and room for
scalpers to operate.

Then comes vendor needs and services layer where are integrations to external
system's like social media and vendor own systems.

At the top there are vendor own digimarketing strategy, which should be doable
to do with the lower layers support and cooperations with vendor and platform
support personnel. To support this cooperation work we have added additional
query questioning layer to operative marketing, figure \ref{fig:mRACEIIQ} on
page \pageref{fig:mRACEIIQ}, to collect data needed to support strategy
iteration loops, figure \ref{fig:iteration} on page \pageref{fig:iteration}.

Figure \ref{fig:layering} on page \pageref{fig:layering} shows global, even
astronomic scale trade area information layering, mixing things purposefully
in figure \ref{fig:layering} on page \pageref{fig:layering}, to create
illustration from frame agreement controlled information space where agreed
roles and agreed trading manner based transactions are driven over globally,
or even astronomically, scalable technology services created for purpose. And
here all official product defining documents; fulfillment statements,
installation, maintenance, user and quick manuals, guarantee and service
contact information are only on electric form, and customer should be able to
do purchase decision based only to those documents information. This product
and related documentation defining information we can call as ASSET, seen in
figure \ref{fig:layering} on page \pageref{fig:layering}. This heavy
documentation called asset describes product items and relations between
multipart product items, it usually is not actual product, but more a market
definition from product, availability areas and dependencies to other area
availability.

\begin{figure} %[H] %\usepackage{float}
 \begin{center}
  \epsfig{figure=figures/layering.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Tradesystem spacetime layering}
  \label{fig:layering}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Below the visible layer vendors can have they own for customer invisible layer
where they prepare they product availability on visible market space (S.
Renken at al. \cite{RenkenNRWC2022}). When product is available vendor gives
CERTIFICATE for trade. Certificate is promise from product availability to
deliver in certain area, place and time frame as vendor see to provide asset
defined product to market using frame agreement agreed trade method, product
definitions on asset and tradeable certificate from product or service
availability on market. OSS licenses also form certificate from unlimited
availability under certain terms without payment, having zero price.

If we have to illustrate trade transaction in tradesystem spacetime it's like
lightning stroke through global, even celestial space, when orbiters like
airplanes, space stations, moon, mars, etc. have economic online transaction
activities. From customer needs and money resources system does resolution to
consumption place or storage space on existing infrastructure. If resolution
finds non-broken chain of dependencies fulfilling the need in consumption,
certificates from all needed components with correct availability are
existing, and on time cumulated price is not exceeding available monetary
resources then purchase, with from included certificate information known
availability times and places is offered for customer to purchase as
transaction approval decision.

\begin{figure} %[H] %\usepackage{float}
 \begin{center}
  \epsfig{figure=figures/resolut.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Resolution from assets and certificates in the spacetime of tradesystem}
  \label{fig:resolut}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

How to deal with this scale setup that it doesn't collapse from the beginning?
From agreement point of view is good to start from frame agreement and some
business area subcontracts holding details for area. From technological
perspective there are some technological basis which scales well and makes
possible cumulate huge masses of information without fear to mixing it.
Certainly we have to offer dedicated views for customer, but those can be just
limitations on browsing asset covering all offers. We should not do silos
until it is necessary, there is enough or those already.

\begin{figure} %[H] %\usepackage{float}
 \begin{center}
  \epsfig{figure=figures/terms.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Frame agreement terms for fluent frictionless trade}
  \label{fig:terms}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

Idea is to define fundamentally global service applicable asset structure,
which is used to define offer. To get offer compelling easy to administrate
and operate we has to have frame agreement for vendors participating to
market. Besides offer we introduce certificates which are vendor given
guarantees that they are ready deliver what they selected to be shown in
asset. Then certificate is actually thing which is traded. Different sectors
like local hospitality, or service stations etc. can be represented as
limited views from whole asset. There are lot of artificial intelligence
developed to be able to do easy limitations to asset visibility for most
needed and relevant ones at time. You could compare to google maps service,
which you can quite easily to use to search cafe's etc. from local area.

%\section{Single minimum asset}
\section{Minimum asset}
\label{minimum_asset}
\index{minimum asset}
Single minimum asset.
Asset in generally is something where customer user want to use hes own
resources time, space and money. Asset in business is something what vendor
can offer which has value and can be changed to money. Single minimum asset is
seen as smallest configuration of items like "Minimum Viable Product" on
vendor offer customer has seen to be ready to commit use hes own resources,
like money, time and space. Asset configuration may hold one or more product
items or services to reach for customer valuable asset configuration which is
what is normally added to vendors offer. It may also hold free zero priced
items customer is willing to consume using hes own resources. While we are
defining fully digital asset, for physical products and services asset
includes marketing material and technical documents defining actual physical
or service item included in asset. Under the ecosystem services asset
configuration need to be linked to all official documents product must have on
that market. Besides mandatory documents there can be optional material, and
linking from other mediums like social media to asset. Combined assets are
forming vendors offer on market.

  \epsfig{figure=figures/asset.eps,width=\textwidth}
  \caption{Asset is item fulfilling consumer need requirements}
  \label{fig:asset}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}


%\section{Certificate as means of exchange}
\section{Certificate}
\label{certificate}
\index{certificate}
Certificate as means of exchange.
While creating fully digital ecosystem services there is need to separate
product definition "asset" and product existence and availability promise
"certificate", which is vendor promise from product availability against
customer own resources money, time and space.

%\section{Where the products are ?}
\section{Product}
\label{product}
\index{product}
Where the products are ?
Product is defined in asset and each product item is then available as
certificate states. Availability place can be defined in both asset and
certificate. Asset item describes general availability on market as product is
meant to be offered on regions. Certificate refines particular product item
availability details, license, business model, pricing mechanism and
transferability or resellability.


%\section{Asset as dependency tree}
\section{Asset dependency}
\label{dependency}
\index{dependency}
Asset as dependency tree.
One product, service etc. in commerce is forming tree which branches form
continuous non-broken chains from sources and requisites to combined offer,
merchandise or service, called asset item which is one part of whole asset
what is offered as vendor offer on market for market. On market asset trees
form forest where trees could be build over others and then being dependent
from others.

From vendor side this chain could include several farmers and logistic
operators, or subcontractors, parts, bill of material lists, their assembly
service and assembled product delivery. Products from assets could form
bundles. Bundles which are treated as tree structure capable to forming new
product asset item in asset item tree, and which is depending from
availability of it's leaf component items, actual items in bundle. Asset
subtree can include physical products, software, service, farmers
environmental certificates, industry player sustainability certificates etc.
For locally created products there could be dependencies to taxation nodes,
language packages and toll nodes which needed to applied when
exported/imported to certain area or region.

\subsection{What is really the hardest part of creating good asset for market?}
\label{selfishness_obstacle}
\index{selfishness obstacle}
Each vendor have they own ideas from they business, whom are they companions,
competitors and in what terms they product is available and for whom. This
holds even they ideas are stupid, hindering whole market growth and they own
profitability too. They will keep they rules even it makes impossible to form
compelling electric commerce asset for market. Who cares, "have been living
like this for years" until today. So short term advantage and fear for
competition is hindering some companies, until they are finding themselves be
outsiders from market, really loosing they business.

\subsection{How we know when we have a good asset?}
\label{asset_goodness}
\index{asset goodness}
Resolution from customer needs to set of asset configuration candidates
fulfilling customer needs should be like thunderstorm lightning strike, fast
and comprehensive, all meaningful branches are gone trough and we have zero on
more resulting branches from customer need requirements filling asset item
findings as solutions for customer needs.

\subsection{How to limit needed customer selections?}
\label{asset_search}
\index{asset search}
Asset structure has to support dependencies to standards, like product
sustainability classification, production geolocation, what customer can use
limit resolution target besides the normal; price, brand, place, size,
availability. Customer should be able to define filter stack per product
category. Or few filter stacks he could select when doing selections for
certain purposes. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) can be used to maintain these filter stacks besides manual
creation and management.

\subsection{How we can get this kind of clean asset?}
\label{asset_cleaness}
\index{asset cleaness}
Because of human opportunistic tendencies\cite{SevenSins} we have to have
strict and straight rules defining how different vendor assets can be combined
to be offered for customer. To form this kind of rules we have to have
agreements.

%\section{Frame agreement}
\section{Agreement}
\label{frame_agreement}
\index{frame agreement}
Frame agreement.
Ecosystem based to Electric Market Frame Agreement (EMFA) and independent legal
entity to maintain it; limited company, foundation or cooperation! This is
important to do now when forming new digital trading based market. It hast to
be created at the start when vendors are applying to market.

\subsection{Why to setup frame agreement?}
\label{frame_agreement_why}
\index{frame agreement why}
There are lot of software and media products etc. with owning business own
opinions which may include idea to negotiate terms customer by customer. We
really do not want to negotiate that for this you product; Can we sell, rent,
combine it to other vendor products and which vendors, if any. IT IS WASTE OF
TIME AND BUSINESS to discuss with these NO Sayers. There is lot of consumers
who have stopped to use paid content, because services offer only some part
from need, and to get wanted offer you have to purchase and utilize several
services. Then they purchase none, or wait years price to go bargain to the
bottom before purchase if even then. Therefore we setup an frame agreement.
You agree that if you get money against your product then customer, or other
vendor, even competitor can utilize you offer as whole or even only one
component from your product as significant part of they own convenience or as
part of created product offer if they wish to do so and get value from it.
Major requirement from frame agreement is that "negotiation" is done only once
against the platform.

Platform support for imported business models, supply and delivery chain
details, can be extended in good cooperation to get most optimal process setup
at operation point, but major requirement is actually "accept frame agreement
or go somewhere else to sell your products" - Don't compromize platform
promise from unified market even cooperation is big part of friction removal
mentioned in Ojanper\"a Platform Strategy book\cite{ojanpera2021platform}, it
should not allowed to steer platfrom to ending sidetrack. From platform
operator perspective it's curical to select included business areas in right
order at right time so that generic income financing is mostly enough for the
platform own installation growth. It's good to cooperate and leave new
included economy sectors own friction removing and business enabling
infrastructure investments for vendors interested to do they major business at
that sector. From platform perspective it's enough to agree on frame level,
create needed Application Programming Interfaces (API's), protocols to support
integrated business process on platform level.

Certain business area support has to be done once and well for all vendors to
keep cost down and business profitable. Can't and won't integrate every vendor
own supply, delivery chain integrations into plaform. Vendors can use they
existing automations for they offer creation but offer on platform is tied to
frame agreement. Asset structure itself has inbuilt possibility to create new
combined assets based offer. Purchace triggers components delivery. For
business scale and profitability platform will offer common possibilities for
business automation under frame agreement. Frame agreement has define and
support these combined offers, new business creation and existence in long
run.

Secondary targets on frame has reduction of artificial value chains created
by discriminating certain customer classes. On highly educated areas is common
trend that even customers are very well capable and eligible to do
professional things the local stores and store chains do not sell products,
tools and supplies at all for individual consumers. Same is for professional
information, it's hided under marketing trash pushed through search engines
and social media. Therefore platform is needed where detailed official product
information is stored over very effective, economical and scalable way in
asset structure, which allow more service oriented companies to automate
sales, do lot of management, sales batch splitting effectively by themselves
or by using service provider from market and overcome this trend where
individual customers assumed smaller purchases is assumed to have bigger
information and service need is discriminated by default. Frame agreement is
needed to get rid of customer class discrimination. If customer is capable to
find vendor or service chain creating product or service on price customer is
willing to pay then sale transaction should also happen.

Minor target is to empower regional players to proof and brand they own
products for global market by bringing classification services to market so
that vendor can improve they own asset information for other region by using
regional classification services and then social marketing called
automarketing to bring products on peoples awareness. Currently delivery
chains from region to other include rebranding copy products and this
rebranding may include classification service or just distributing vendor
statement from fit to purpose. Anyhow rebranding copy product usually creates
some unnecessary overhead which can be overcome by offering good visibility to
standards and classification services to prove they products quality from
start and avoid proofing several times from several distributors.

\subsection{What to agree with the Frame Agreement?}
\label{frame_agreement_what}
\index{frame agreement what}
Frame agreement purpose is to make safe non-discriminatory market having all
normal standardized business models (sale - purchase - resale, maintain -
serve - subscript - transfer, lease - rent, share, ..) and related pricing
methods (cost-plus, time based, variable, dynamic) supported in way anyone in
market can create combined product, collect ingredients, add own effort, use
it as such or sell as new product. Everything can be mixed directly from
market and sold further with configuration created vendors liability as long
as configuration component bills are paid.

Agreement define certificate what vendor brings to market. Defined
certificate is the sold thing in market. Certificate against the goods and
services are delivered. Frame agreement also defines technical rules and
methods implemented as platform library methods what used when digitally
protected medias are used. EU Governmental Digital Preservation takes
unprotected originals to protected archive and create protected version to
trade operators public archive. Vendor has to deliver clear originals with
documentation and tested scripts for protected version creation to Digital
preservation\cite{EULegalDepositScheme}, which then runs scripts to create
protected version from originals to market. Originals are stamped to keep
protected copyright time, and then released automatically to public space.
Sold certificate is mortgaged at bank value account book
entry\cite{BookEntry}\cite{LEX_2017/384}\cite{EU_Settlement} to deliver media
or software keys to device to unlock software or media on they device.

Frame agreement include sections for the governmental players e.g. toll,
taxation, tax is one automatically managed dependency in asset.

Agreement also has to have clear rules from mechanisms used to protect from
speculative players, in practice meaning limitation of bulk purchase for goods
having much other customers too. Basically vendor could set bulk purchase
limits suitable to they own product and production volatility tolerance, to
maintain they product brands availability to wide audience without cream
peelers caused shortage harming product brand and future profitability.
Trade operator has to have automatic dynamic default bulk purchase
limitations, like offering vendor widely distributed certificate serie or
purchase redirection to vendor human manged bulk sales team and automatic
follow up so that badly behaving speculative players purchases are
automatically limited, banned for period or even kicked out from market.
Market is meant for fluent ecosystem creation not for speculator handy
tools. For example football match tickets resale could be limited to
average family size for customer or legal instance like limited company.
So if company purchases more than 10 tickets it's not able to sell further
those without separate agreement, only possibility is to return those back
with original price on time limitations when they still are applicable to
return and refund. 

Frame agreement has also include mechanism to limit market damage when
software or media or other company having delivered stock and certificates on
market go bankruptcy or liquidation by hostile market operation. Sales are
automatically continued to protect other vendors business build over these
products. Tangible product sales stop when certificates are sold, intangible
product certificates are generated automatically for sales as before
bankruptcy or hostile takeover. Money from sales is delivered to estate or
usurper. In short vendor can update software product on market and demand
customers to use latest version, but it can not remove product or earlier
versions from market others are already based they business. Hostile upgrade
operation is also neglected by allowing older version use. Only product
security reasons can be used to reason product ban from market, still others
are allowed to use component under they own products if they can overcome
security issues in they own configuration. For example by using snap packages
for software to allow cherry pick used libraries and configurations more
independently from host platfrom update cycle, and this way allows to prolong
software component use, get time for business to adabt and migitate possible
financial risks from sudden change in ecosystem asset.

\section{Roles and terms}
\label{roles_and_terms}
\index{roles and terms}
To be able to define how ecosystem really works we have to define roles and
terms we can define. While definition es clear for reader he could understand
the whole story where these roles and terms are used.

\subsection{Customer}
\label{customer}
\index{customer}
Customer is actor willing to get something from offered asset items and might
be willing to pay something to get what he is willing to get. It might be that
offered assets hasn't have needed and wanted items configuration available.
One simple example is customer needing one or two items from products sold
only in boxes holding way too many peaces of items to be sensible for customer
to buy.

\subsection{Recycle fee}
\label{recycle_fee}
\index{recycle fee}
Most customers do not have persistence to care used goods to recycling without
any incentive after they own use is ended. Per product defined recycle fee
guarantees that someone is interested to care from recycling if customer
doesn't and used product value is negative without attached recycle fee.
Recycle fee purpose is to make used product value so positive that recycle
happens.

\subsection{Recycle services}
\label{recycle_services}
\index{recycle services}
Recycle services care professionally from recycling. Actual recycling depends
on product and customer value left in it. Recycling services classify, perhaps
maintain and resale product. If original use continue then recycle fee is
still attached to product. When product original use ends then recycle fee is
used to make possible to proceed negative value product further processing on
recycle services so that there are no unnecessary environmental load left
after product original use ends. Recycle services can have trade operator role
for reusable products, or they can use original trade operator to do the used
product resale under used category.

\subsection{Influencer}
\label{influencer}
\index{influencer}
Influencer is people doing commercial or semi commercial marketing, usually
producing marketing material to social media environment. When this marketing
material is not directly vendor created, creator is not directly legally
responsible from any errors material may have. Still usually these social
groups trust more to these reference group materials they feel to be as
customer reviews for products, even it's not whole truth. Ecosystem should
offer clear reference mechanism to reference products, product defining
official vendor documents in asset from social media direction.

\subsection{Vendor}
\label{vendor}
\index{vendor}
Vendor is legal entity agreed ecosystem frame agreement, taking product
responsibility and gets right to added asset items to offered product
configurations sold against certificates. Asset forms the content defining the
sold configuration content. Certificate defines the availability and trade
system gives price for certificate depending the pricing modes vendor has
selected for configuration items.

\subsection{Bundle}
\label{bundle}
\index{bundle}
Bundle is from vendor offered sold items created configuration which items
legal responsibility stays on each vendor selling the item. Bundle is meant
for several uses. Vendor can utilize it for marketing campaign he references
from campaign. It can be used as customer purchase list when customer creates
configuration he want to buy. It can be used as influencer-customer created
product combination he/she is referring from social media while he
communicates for hes reference group or followers.

\subsection{Bank}
\label{bank}
\index{bank}
Banks has to be extended from value-account perspective. Bank works as
trade-operator doing trade transactions purchasing and selling certificates
from trade-operator, bookkeeping is kept on value account. Groceries are kept
on own folder, product having guarantee on own folder and resellable software
licenses etc. on it's own.

Besides the software etc. vendors license and locking management bank do
certificate mortgage against for the device generated keys.

Teleoperator can also play role of bank, and then should be legally treated as
bank or relevant financial institution from local legal law perspective. In
many developing countries teleoperators do have banking services.

\subsection{Trade operator}
\label{trade_operator}
\index{trade operator}
Besides bank there has to setup for trade operator services. Trade operator
takes in asset trees and linked materials which all are checked and archived
at the beginning. Trading starts when operator lifts archived material
visible to cloud edge. Customer can browse and do resolution, resolution for
wanted good for certain target like area, device, delivery day, etc. other
dependency needed to be met. 

Actual trading can be made when vendors deliver certificates, which state
asset defined product availability on market. Certificates are sold for value
account and usually changed immediately for goods and services. Logistic
operators can also define they asset and then sell certificates for delivery
slots they have.

This makes possible to create and maintain local delivery chains for market on
market. Trade operator is also market supervisor, makes sure that frame
agreement and it's rules are understood and accepted before entering market.
It's also remove and sanction players violating generally accepted market
rules.

How to make sure that someone doesn't steal or copy certificate and claim
products against it? Actual product delivery is done based to proven
transactions, meaning that bank verifies who has certificate on hes value
account and deliver recipe including payer and delivery information to vendor.

\subsection{Trade technology provider}
\label{tehnology_provider}
\index{technology provider}

Trade technology provider is key player while it provides technology services,
consulting and cooperation for trade operators, mobile terminal vendors, banks,
authorities, ecosystem vendors and finally for ecosystem customers. Vendors and
customers trust for fair, non-discriminating, undisturbed, future proof,
ecosystem is mandatory to achieve. Therefore fully open "copy left" software
components has to be used. There is still enough money coming in because banks
want to stay relevant also in future, and are willing to finance non-profit
organization like foundation or cooperation to do the work. Governments may
also support political economy fluency and profitability improving technology
creation and maintenance.

There are similar shared technologies already existing on human identification
and healthcare areas where common technologies are developed and used on
several vendors and service providers services. Digital- and cryptocurrencies
are cutting corners, mobile terminal vendors enable mobile paying with
terminals, network operators may offer banking services, retail store chains
are supporting mobile payment and extra services, like electric receipts,
bookkeeping from purchased certificates, especially from those still including
some value like licenses and product guarantees under user account. When
employer start to pay employee wage with mobile digital money then banks start
to be irrelevant for some customers.

Banks are really left behind and it start to be questionable why they exists,
are they relevant to customer anymore. 

Banks has to think how to stay relevant.

Therefore there will high competition from the technology pro\-viders place,
from winning technology stack, ownership and monetizing it with the
governments support. It is too big money making machine to let some profit
hungry corporation to have monopolistic applications stack as only available
option. We have to have non-profit cooperative and open setup for this.

\subsection{National Digital Preservation}
\label{digital_preservation}
\index{digital preservation}
National digital preservation legal deposit\cite{Vapaakappaleoikeus} takes
unencrypted originals, sources, components and store those to protected
national archive. Because author death plus $n$ years where $n$ about 50-70 is
hard to follow we can take fixed time as Copyright time which is nearly 109
years. After the end of copyright period unencrypted originals, sources,
components are published besides the protected ones on market asset archive.
Comparing to Walt Disneys Mickey Mouse: Protection time is about 1966-1928+70
years = 108 years which is about 0xCCCCCCCC seconds being easy to remember
"CCCCCCCCopyright" seconds time. Should be enough, no need to have own value
for each country (Wikipedia\cite{CopyrightLengths}).

\subsection{Archival services}
\label{archival_services}
\index{archival services}
At the begin of asset creation it will be archived on archival tier services
because there are no more users for item than it's creator. Asset can be on
protected services as under ecosystem services.

Protected asset could work as Bill Of Material (BOM) for company work products
based to they own internal needs. Protected asset could refer, depend from
other products as raw materials ordered for product creation. Important thing
for the vendor is possibility to get raw materials availability and delivery
times for the needed components. Vendors can also cooperate and  do automation
under the market hood.

Public asset is then created for the products meant to be sold for customers,
and certificates can be published based from protected asset dependency
resolution given delivery times and own work and own delivery time estimations
at the time. It is also possible to operate with fully public internal asset.

Of course it gives some information for customer and competitors, but it might
be first phase when some influencer marketing person person creates bundle
definition from assets he thinks fit together and marketing it for social
reference group he belongs to. Commercial asset setup is still legally on
official vendors responsibility.



\section{Technologies to be created}
\label{technologies}
\index{technologies}

\subsection{Asset structure}
\label{asset_structure}
\index{asset structure}
Most important is the asset structure which allow vendors to decide which part
is they internal bill of material, and from where starts they sellable product
or do they offer everything as product and spare parts.

Well proven working models to look ideas for asset structure are Debian "dep"
package repositories, RedHat Package Manager "rpm" repositories and Git
version control, from where to do generalization to platform independent
level, like using RFC 2119\cite{rfc2119} keywords, additional keywords like
"FULFILLS", "FOLLOWS", "OFFERS", "PROVIDES" and what already found from
mentioned rpm and dep repository structures.

There is need for asset as repository generalization as repository holding
possibility to run it as block chain where all is archived and then latest are
brought to cloud edge services and multiplied on service load need bases. And
still structure has to hold all information to show in human readable form as
well. Cryptography based block chain is best for the asset, because you can
save years and years over the old asset without problems, just move less
accessed parts to archive servers.

For future needs all conformance, guarantee, manual and quick setup papers has
to be part of asset even fruitlabels with possible variations are stored in
electrical from as part of asset. Then sold certificate tied to delivered lot
refers to label document defined in asset. If new quality is introduced then
asset is extended, top nodes recreated and written to asset repository.

Due to nature of asset as block chain stock, it is easy to offer
"barefoot-network" -delivery for selected media bulk on rural areas where
wireless network coverage and available bandwidth do not allow to transfer
bulk over the air and wired connections do not exists. There usually
electricity availability is also scarce resource and peoples go to charging
stations or other places where electricity is available. Then selected parts
of asset tree can be carried with the terminal and shared through USB,
bluetooth, wlan while charged. Transfers can be two directional uploading some
assets to charging station and downloading something else. For example
software updates, e-books, music and movies can be transferred. Maybe existing
charging stations can be upgraded with mobile managed physical mail box
closures too then there is possibility two direction tangible products
delivery too withing application.

\subsection{Resolution process}
\label{resolution}
\index{resolution}

Resolution process does customer need based selection from assets. First it
does asset view limitation to human understandable set based to predefined
selections like non-lactose, ecologically cultivated food. These limitations
can be searched as certifications or standards on asset the selected asset is
stated to fulfill.  

If we think customer device software asset resolution, then resolver checks
which hardware and software it's running on and then do the resolution from
wanted configuration to platform underneath. If non-broken dependency chain is
found and there are certificates available to purchase for components needing
those, then resolution is done successfully and purchase, download and
installation process can be done as final step of resolution.  

\subsection{Client application}
\label{client_application}
\index{client application}
\index{application, client}

Client application will be capable to do resolutions based to categories,
classification, dependencies, price range. Most important capability is
capability to follow dependencies from the wanted to platform, interface,
standard, list, etc. Most simplest is to look food name, and got list of
vendor made ready products and recipe with the dependent ingredients. One
product or whole list can be purchased. With the rules you could limit what
will be shown: cheapest, brand,.. most used.. available now. Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to collect
reduction related rules. Client application can also utilize into terminal
pre-loaded assets or from peer transferred assets without network coverage.
For the protected content usage initiation, there is need to have at least
some network coverage for key-delivery, but it's enough to have very low
bandwidth, even GSM control channel capacity might be enough.

\subsection{Customer terminal}
\label{customer_terminal}
\index{customer terminal}
\index{terminal, customer}

Networked wireless customer terminal; PC, tablet, phone, iot-device,.. could
and should be capable to use same dependency resolution and capability
installation mechanism starting from government regulated wireless
communication device e.g. cellular modem created remote pre-execution-boot
capability. Installation of whole software stack should be capable to do
directly from the asset tree, including actual client application mentioned
above has to be supported. Into cellular modem included key services are
connected to user service provider, which is normally customers bank. Through
bank customer get the financing and bookkeeping. Bookkeeping from purchases,
purchase guarantees, certificates, certificate mortgage and protected content
key generation services, so if he want to run digitally protected protected.
Then with the client application you can add more abilities, or purchase
something totally different than software, media and communication services. 
For example those grocery purchases can be done directly from client
application. Some additional storage memory might be useful for users terminal
to have, at least for locally stored assets.

\subsection{Original vendor label and certificate creation service}
\label{label_and_certificate_service}
\index{label and certificate service}
\index{service, label}
\index{service, certificate}

Vendors need mobile device software used to read container, pallet, container
codes, time and place (GPS) linked to electric labels on asset. Bulk delivery
certificates are formed as pallet lists and container content lists which all
signed by vendor to from certificate tree. Certificate tree which can be sold.
If sold as exported goods we could have "tax, toll, environmental, and social
payment products" in asset vendor can purchase for lots meant to be exported
to form asset ready for export.

For certificate delivery to trading or banking services used care from actual
trading there is need to have possibility to sign certificate on device and
encrypt it with public key cryptography for transfer so that receiving end can
verify that certificate is coming directly from vendor.

On the shop we should have electric labels showing product lot information.
Customers need software or web page what to use to check what is put in the
cases of lot, who has filled it and from where. With this electric service set
we should get rid off printed labels which are pain in ass in automated
delivery chain. Printers do not work and labels do no hold on plastic cases,
causing problems in automation, and it is just adding unnecessary cost.

\subsection{Authority terminal services}
\label{authority_terminal_service}
\index{authority terminal service}
\index{terminal service, authority}

Based to customer terminal setup additional software tools are offered for
tolls to verify delivery and do they work, e.g. check that taxes and tolls
required are paid and connected to asset. Authority can then sign electric
delivery having tax and toll payments attached with they own signature
forming an export ready asset. Same tools can be used to check imported
goods that tolls, taxes, operating costs are paid for imported lot. And
authority can sign created asset ready for import.

\subsection{Value account service}
\label{value_account_service}
\index{value acount service}
\index{service, value account}

Existing banking service has to be extended with the needed tools and
services. Value account most needed capability is to maintain resellable
certificates and offer certificate mortgage services against key generation.
Resellable merchandise certificate mortgage and key services.
To get software market to work there is need to take software media and key
service under the third party, which guarantee SW availability and key
generation services instead vendor. This protects product value and offers key
services for the software customer. Software unencrypted originals are
archived under the digital preservation legal
deposit\cite{EULegalDepositScheme} terms and spirit under national archive
services, having copies on each country products are published. Protected
copies are stored to asset archive and banks are running key management
service for customer. Customer could select bank, but he need these services
from some bank to use protected products. Actual trade is done by selling
vendor certificates, which are then transferred to customer's value account.
When used resellable certificate is mortgaged against the key generation, and
key is delivered into customer terminal cellular modem included key services
and used to enable capabilities on device. And when usage is ended same
service can remove key from device and release certificate from value account
for resale on market. Consumables certificates are fully used on delivery.
Rentable related certificates are removed from value account after rent period
end, etcetera. For the the key services is enough to have SMS connection,
actually meaning GSM slow control channel connection, which is used for SMS.
%Trading service
Trading service can be built under banking operations and services. It will
show asset, against client needs resolution is done, and product availability
information in form of certificates against the purchase is done. Trading
service could also be purchased service from trade operator willing to invest
this business area. Independent trading service operator is most preferred
because then operation can be legally guided and optimized for purpose. There
could be foundation based setup doing trading service setup and technology
development.
Optimization for grocery bulk.
It might not be wise to take bulk groceries under trade actions, just deliver
needed results, like guarantee certificates etc. under value account. One
possibility is that grocery store introduce sold products to trade system and
bank bookkeeping after the sale. At lest those product certificates which are
resellable should be booked to trade system. This may need separate sub
agreement to go through area in detail.

Automarketing is reimbursement capability for platform marketing money what
each vendor has to pay for platform. Money is used for loyalty programs where
customer created bundle definitions used as purchase lists so that he
remembers to purchase all. We give customer hes fair share of hes
semi-automated purchases as discount from price. Customer could also create
bundle definition from hes earlier purchase. While replaying purchase discount
is calculated. Customer involvement to marketing is increased with possibility
to get marketing money out from other users purchases by creating bundles and
acting as influencer user. Same mechanism is used to pay influencer-customer
from bundles he manages to market on social media or any other way. Bundle
itself includes automatic statement that configuration is customer created and
vendors are giving guarantees only for single items as stated on product
official documentation on offered asset tree. Customer created bundle
configuration itself has no guarantee from fit for purpose.
Influencer-customer gains marketing money he/she may get out as services,
products or money, depending from local laws,  to support hes activity.
Influencer-customers are encouraged to incorporate they efforts into ecosystem
as vendor having product responsibility and they configuration fit for
purpose, which means that they have official configuration describing document
in asset. Then they can get pure money for they account from they marketing
work what they are done. Bundle definitions are directly stored to slow
archival medium, and on cloud based systems those bundles which are
significantly sold are lifted to cloud edge for fast service response times.

\subsection{Automarketing algorithm}
\label{automarketing}
\index{automarketing}

Each product in asset pay marketing money and will get refund comparing to
it's significance in configuration. Significance is defined as inverse of node
depth in configuration. Rest marketing money goes to each configuration root
node as node's own marketing money. When several configurations form new
bigger configuration then algorithm counts leaf configurations first and then
proceeds towards upper configurations setting and counts sub-configuration
roots as upper configuration leaf, from counted marketing money inverse from
node depth is returned to configuration creator, rest is going to upper
configuration root.

\section{Responsibility sustainability}
\label{responsibility_sustainability}
\index{responsibility sustainability}

While this digitization improves peoples capability to utilize all possible
resources and consume more, we have to have mechanisms to maintain
sustainability and fair trade? Or what you say?

Big trend is the customers environmental awareness rise which is lifting head
even peoples are lazy and existing  big players may try to hinder change due
they own  benefit dependency to some clearly outdated way to live here in this
single earth we have. Or if you have some spare earths to consume, please tell
that for others too, then they may be able to continue as nothing has
happened.

Consumption redirection from pure material consumption towards more social
services and different kind of development activities tweaking economy towards
more sustainable technology use and life style fitting to existing sustainable
capabilities we have. Old way living may require heavy investment to sea,
solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear energy to create fuels from air and water
without fossil fuel resources utilization. And new creative ways of farming
food is also needed.

Risk is that autocratic chieftains drive they own very short term benefits,
peoples resisting change are supporting these chieftains, against they own and
they children's benefit. Then result is global repetition from what happened
on Easter Island on earth last resort where we get clan chieftain moʻai
repetition when all key resources are used and system collapse.

\subsection{Product tracking}
\label{product_tracking}
\index{product tracking}
\index{tracking, product}

Product tracking along delivery route is one way to make sure that product
fulfills some socioeconomical and environmental compatibility with the
standards and certificates. Product tracking from production site by
utilizing worker and/or en\-tre\-pre\-neurs own mobile device, logistic
operator signature authorities signatures, distribution center signature from
receiving. Distribution center splitted assets including reference to original
incoming signed delivery. Work payments inclusion into asset as already paid
components of product which price is cumulated to upper level by payer, or as
direct payment requiring parts of delivery in asset where all sub parts are
paid same time. Geolocation marks can be used to check original harvesting area.

\subsection{Standards and certification}
\label{standards_and_certification}
\index{standards and certification}

What ever standards or certifications vendor delivered products are following,
there can be they own statement from fulfillment and reference to inspection
body given digitally signed certificate and/or reference to inspection body
service from where to check certificate validity. It would be interesting
question to check what is cost to check if customer purchasing some standard
fulfilling product could be deserved right to get standard text visible in
electric form from asset when purchasing product. If this cost is possible to
embedded into platform cost and make all standards available by default, most
peoples do not want to download everything, which means it's more available
for creation and quality check reasons. Anyhow all standards are brought to
platform so that they can be referred and standard texts are also available
for purchase as any other product.

\subsection{Quality tracking}
\label{quality_tracking}
\index{quality tracking}
\index{tracking, quality}

All parties participating to product brand creation have to have balanced
visibility to vendors products and should be able to comparing product
reliability: how clear and accurate given information is to others. We have to
avoid situation we can see from some current existing trade platforms, where
product return rate is not told and user comments from returned product
returning reasons are removed. Yep, it's somehow fair for vendor that if they
return money from returned product then customer complains are not shown, but
same time it allows to vendor continue to deliver shitty products, which do
not fulfill even vendor own marketing specs, ahead to new unaware customers,
expecting that some customers have lower requirements or they are too lazy or
too busy to return product on time to get money back, even product doesn't
fulfill customer needs. This is irresponsible use of everyone's resources, and
has to forced to cease. Vendor has to have product/service matching to asset
documentation and certificate's delivery promise.

To get products comparable with the each other we have to have measures:
\begin{itemize}
\item Product official asset documentation and certificate information fulfillment on delivery. Does product fulfill or exceed it's specs on unboxing event?
\item Promised guarantee time and promised support time for sold product/service?
\item Error tracking. Does product/service have single, occasional or repeating malfunction or operation outside of specs? Does error occur during first two weeks from purchase/unboxing, during guarantee time or during normal expected lifetime? What is error fixing rate for noted errors?
\item Product return rate and reasons for return, possibly as link to error tracking having detailed product version information.
\item Reputation in known customer responses, one +/- vote per response per customer.
\end{itemize}

From measures automatically created quality value could be used to comparison,
comparing to known competing reference products quality values, and for
products quality/price ratio evaluation.

\subsection{Customer protection}
\label{customer_protection}
\index{customer protection}

There is lot of people who have used to use cash money and get control to they
spending from physical money transfer during purchase. With this electric
possibility to purchase they may loose control to they spending and to whole
life. One possibility to guarantee some continuity is to have income account
where is automatic sliding year daily taxation with the negative tax values
for days peoples didn't have any income. When peoples get money, perhaps
afterwords, then payment is distributed over the period time payment is
cumulated and taxation has been repeated. Corrected tax is taken from payment
during correction and rest is paid to account. This way we guarantee that
peoples have some money on every day and even all short jobs can increase
total income without some governments favored stepwise rules which cause
incentive traps here and there. See details Daily Tax booklet\cite{DayTax}
%attached as appendix starting from page numbered as \pageref{dailytax}
.

\subsection{Integration to housing and logistics}
\label{integration}
\index{integration, housing}
\index{integration, logistics}
Integration to housing, even it's new investment, may offer savings in long
run if widely accepted an used. As block of flats may now have post box
closures, those closures can be expanded to hold temperature and gas
controlled closures for food delivery. This can reduce private car usage when
one delivery car can bring several deliveries at once. Anyhow the whole
delivery logistic: containers, trucks, pallets, cages, cases, temperature,
moisture, humidity and gas  zones and automatic handling machinery
requirements has to be taken in account. Now there are lot of partly optimized
solutions for different usages and zones and dimensions are also differing
from hand carried imperial unit size cases to automation optimized metric
cases. In generally there is lot of things to do which are lacking public
discussion starting from different needs and how to bring whole delivery chain
to fluent, mostly automated state. We could start to think requirements from
initial producer and from end user perspective and then add requirements from
automation and logistics. Because end user is paying then it's maybe best
point to start. Most of customers purchase most often daily products. What are
they requirements, how they think  from new initiatives, for example from two
door closure through detached house wall. Closure having five temperature
zones from bottom to top; frozen, cold, chilly, room temperature, hot, about
from \textminus25\textdegree C to +75\textdegree C, as producer and food
control officials recommend for temperature controlled delivery chain.
Meaning that delivery service can bring standard size automation optimized
recyclable boxes through outer wall door to closure. Whole closure and boxes
has to be productized for both housing and logistics industry and if possible
be compatible with freezer, fridge, oven, dishwasher and standard room
closure. It is then more question from what is feasible. Current
infrastructure installed base is huge. In this document we have to leave this
integration discussion to this level and concentrate to actual frame
agreement and tradesystem. Frame agreement could then define details later on
when feasible requirements are noticed. 

\subsection{Wholesale integration}
\label{wholesale}
\index{wholesale}
Wholesale is basically vendor, but now days usually integral part of retail
chain. Integration willingness and timetable may wary significantly. Anyhow
light integration where sold goods having guarantee or contain on market
resellable items, should be listed on customer value account and trade
operator sold items hash list on archive, so that if coming to resale,
tradeoperator can trust item existence and authenticity. Deeper integration
should be done as integrating customer and vendor roles for wholesale inbound
and outbound, as well there is possibility to have invisible layers for
business to business connections, see figure \ref{fig:layering} on page
\pageref{fig:layering}.

\subsection{General inclusion, integration to society}
\label{inclusion}
\index{inclusion}

Most of technology hast to be standardized to and offered openly for the
others too as a service to get wider acceptance on society. Trade technology
provider and operator is significant market player it is good to prepare to
offer created banking and trading technologies for the other players as
technology services. Good to prepare before forced to do so due market
position. Cooperation and support are given from integration possibilites.
For end user visible application interfaces (API) etc. are strightly
controlled, but unvisible B2B connections can freely utilize existing or
whatever connections as long as public asset offer promises can be met by
using those.
