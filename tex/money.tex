\chapter{Monetary system}
\label{monetary_system}
\index{monetary system}
Monetary system development and extension need. Monetary system what national and union banks maintain is left behind from native digital citizens and market digital development needs. It's time to tackle digital trade problems by rising abstraction level of exchanged valuables and same time removing trust problems with the frame agreement defining standardized digitalized and supported business models on agreement and trade platform level. And maybe later on we have laws supporting frame agreement based market operation. To really to do frictionless trade we have to digitalize and standardize goods and services digital presence at least on ecosystem frame agreement level. What is product or service digital presence - asset - sold on digital market before any products or services are delivered? Or does the vendor delivery promise - certificate - be the thing to sell?

I would like to say that in digital trade, e-commerce, - asset - is product marketing documentation offering, customer need fulfilling solution, with customer value bigger that price value for customer, and sale is happening if products are available, meaning if vendor given - certificate - "promise" from availability is available and delivery terms are matching to customer's customer value idea customer has got from product documentation called asset. So in this document: Asset is the product or service description. Certificate is asset defined product or service delivery promise to certain place at certain time, at certain price. Certificate (vendor-promise) is what is actually sold !

\section{Traditional}
Traditional monetary system. Legal system is set so that generally banks are only legal entities legitimized to produce state backed money, money which has legally supported status and known behaving model. Amount of money on market affects to it's value on market. If amount of money is small compared to market size then money desirability rise because everyone on market want to change they goods and services. This limits trading and rise of product price, because most to offer for exchange medium wins medium and does exchange. If others still exchange they products against smaller amount of money then money value is grown and that is called to deflation. If there are lot of money on market then all can do exchange at the same time without limitations and then asked money amounts from same products grow because there is lot of money available and can be asked more. This is called inflation which means change medium value decrease. To control market operation governments, national and unions central banks have some operations to manage total amount of money on market as well control inflation or deflation on market.

Increasing money amount on market:
\begin{itemize}
\item Release tangible money to circulation
\item Release intangible money to circulation
\item Negative Interest of loan
\item Positive Interest of saving
\item Loan of money
\item Purchase of bonds by central banks
\end{itemize}

Decreasing money amount on market:
\begin{itemize}
\item Returned tangible money from circulation
\item Returned intangible money from circulation
\item Positive interest of loan
\item Negative interest of saving
\item Payment of loaned money and positive interest
\item Non-returned worn or lost tangible money
\item Non-returned corrupted or lost intangible money
\end{itemize}

\section{Electric money}
There are several intangible electric money activities ongoing. It's hard to say do we really get any elecktrick money which removes possibility to have full payment chain visibility or possibility to do full payment chain resolution afterwards and this way eliminate possible fraud from market by removing cheating player by allowing to detect cheating memeber. There are setups which are called to e-money even those are actually electric transactions between service provider maintained bank accounts.

It's possible to automate old check system, by doing full signature and encryption chain where each owner does check signature and encryption with receiver public key. But then it's obvious who had participated into payment chain.

Pure eletric bank note initiated and signed by your bank, or central bank, agaist money on your account is easily under thread if first recetive is not the last one too. Check note is ecrypted with your public encrypting key for delivery. When used it's send to receiver with public key encryption. During transfer everyone store instance encryption is removed and new done by each holder. Final receiver is again a bank and it pays amount of money for sender against the note. Final receiver name is stored by bank to allow fraud detection, by backward tracing. With successful access chain all mid-holders are not known. Every owner knows and stores last and next legitime owner, but not the whole chain.

Because these security problems direct bank transfers are preferred on electric trade.

\section{Quantitative Easing}
Era of Quantitative Easing (QE). It has been thought that peoples and organizations who did and do most from new productive investments finance those investmens with loan and therefore giving them benefit with negative interest rates and junk bond purchases and acceptance to mortage gives best boost to economy. But that is not true anymore, not even been when quantitative easing started at 2008 crisis. Those organizations had put easy money to living and unproductive investments without actually incesting to sustainable growth. More and more money goes to easy wins and protecting they position and status on earth, our market place. Protecting they own living standard without any even small willingess to change sustainable business models. Why? They think that it's easier to protect existing just now than create new business. And in short time it be so, allowing to transfer more money to consumption; cars, houses, cottages, jets, boats, second, third, fourth houses, willas with maintenace, even if not used at all. So most usable money went to consumption, not to sensible new business creation nor social investments like education etc. Even central bank has supported this old, mostly by fossile fules driven economy, consumption style which is coming to dead end because our market place earth doesn't tolerate it. It's not enymore need to blow up climet satellite with normal bolt set between rocket phases where you should have exploding one. Everyone here can notice change even without that satellite. Glaciers are melting and draut follows here and there. And those bosses used most of money to they own consumption are now coming to dead end, some even started wars to keep exixting fossiles backed business model and gain more for themself. It does not work anymore, everyone will loose if continuing that way, we are not sure can we get this thing turned right even if we all work seamlessy together towards sustainable goal where economy expansion is on space and sustainable business models on earth. Extinktion is on offer plate if we doesn't understand common good. Money wise, because money is only number, growth can continue on earth, but is more or less social services growth and recycling growth.

It's is good to notice that all entrepreneurs do not belong to this greedy group and have grown they business mostly with income financing and caring from sustainability. Still amount of outdated business and nonproductive play with financial market without actually producing any good is taking too big part from whole economy. Therefore artificial respiration of these dead businesses with QE is coming to end. These not-trustable, cheating, frighthening and even violent organizations has to be let to stay on they own and concentrate to original producer or service creator possibility to do business straightly with the customer. Then environment aware peoples can wote with they wallet when systen has been built right. Business natural tendence to renew and prune dead ends has to be restored by ending QE. QE successor (Sustainable Financing \cite{EU_Sustainable_finance}) has to have long term sustainaility or space utilization targets for expansion, dead end public support financing has to end. Negative intrest rate is normally taken from normal worker's back by reducing the value of his/her money, and giving it to those who has too much already, and whose are already underperforming by sticking to old world, grabbing only wery short term local wins, and spoiling larger community possibilities to live good life. Risk is that autocratic chieftains drive they own very short term benefits and peoples resisting change are supporting these chieftains against they own and they children benefit. Then result is global repetition from what happened on Easter Island on earth last resort where we get clan chieftain moai repetition when all key resources are used and system collapses.

\section{Trust}
\label{trust}
\index{trust}
Legal basement for monetary system requires definition of legal entities definitions, then actual law text could refer to these defined legal entities and define they roles, rules and consequences of non-compliance. Most used legal entity roles are; natural person, corporate body, commune, bank, nation, national property register, national bank, national tax, national toll, central bank, central tax, central toll, exchange and national archive. Operations these several legal entities can do are for example: exchange (sell \& buy), tax, toll, loan, mortgage, refinance (national and central banks), rate (national and central banks), etc. Exchange of goods and services using money and money kind abstract valuables is based to peoples trust. Governments have based legal framework to maintain peoples trust to these valuables to make goods and services exchange easy and effective.

\section{Exchange}
\label{exhange}
\index{exhange}
When peoples do something they need others help to reach bigger advancements that they can do alone. To be fear there is need for reciprocity and it's hard to archive in bigger scale without some medium of exchange. Therefore some selected valuable easy to exchange commodities started to be used as medium of exchange. While economy grow more there were greater need to have more abstract medium of exchange and legal basement for that created to maintain peoples trust to it. Exchange valuables; coin, bank note, dept, bond, commodity, share, property, mortgage, derivative and certificate. This certificate and operations for it are new things we are interested to define for digital trade, e-commerce.
